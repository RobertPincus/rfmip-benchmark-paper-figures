This reporsitory contains data and a Python 3.7 Jupyter notebook used to produce the figures for 
"Benchmark calculations of radiative forcing by greenhouse gases" by Robert Pincus et al., 2020, 
to appear in Journal of Geophysical Research - Atmospheres with 
doi:[10.1002/2020JD033483](https://doi.org/10.1002/2020JD033483). 

The netCDF files contain reduced versions of data from the Earth System Grid. They can in principle 
be regenerated by running the `compute-lbl-gcm-global-mean-forcing.py` script although one of the servers hosting 
the GCM data is frequently unavailable.
